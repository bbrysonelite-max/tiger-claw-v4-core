## Problem Statement

Sales and recruiting professionals spend the majority of their working hours
finding people to talk to, not talking to them. Manual prospect research is
slow, inconsistent, and requires technical skills most people don't have.

When they do find prospects, they don't know what to say, they forget to follow
up, and they lose deals to silence.

Tiger Claw eliminates all of that. The agent finds the people, scores them,
writes the messages, sends them, handles objections, nurtures the relationship,
and follows up after every sale — automatically, while the customer sleeps.

## Core User Journey

### Day 0 — Signup

1. Customer lands on `thegoods.ai`
2. Clicks "Get Started" → 5-step wizard
3. **Step 1:** Picks their industry flavor (11 options)
4. **Step 2:** Name, email, language, timezone
5. **Step 3:** Enters their Google API key — validated server-side before proceeding
6. **Step 4:** Pays via Stripe ($99/mo Scout plan)
7. **Step 5:** Receives their Telegram bot username + deep link

Provisioning email arrives with activation link. Customer clicks it. Bot activates.

**From signup to live agent: under 5 minutes.**

### Day 1 — First Interaction

Customer messages their Telegram bot.

Tiger Claw runs the 5-phase `tiger_onboard` interview:
1. Who are you looking for?
2. What result do you want for them?
3. What's your main channel?
4. What objections do you usually face?
5. What does your best prospect look like?

After the interview, the agent is fully calibrated. It starts working.

### Every Day — Autonomous Operation

```
7:00 AM — Daily Briefing
  5 prospects discovered overnight
  Each with score, source, opening message, objection scripts

Ongoing — Agent works 24/7
  Scouts for buying signals
  Scores every prospect
  Sends outreach (80+ score only)
  Manages replies and objections
  Moves leads through the pipeline
  Nurtures prospects who aren't ready yet
  Follows up after every sale
```

Customer checks the dashboard to see the pipeline. That's it.
