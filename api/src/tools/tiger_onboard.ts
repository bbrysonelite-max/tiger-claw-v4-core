// Tiger Claw — tiger_onboard Tool
// Onboarding interview flow — Block 5, Section 5.2 of TIGERCLAW-MASTER-SPEC-v2.md
//
// Five phases:
//   Phase 1 — Identity: "Who are you?" (6 questions)
//   Phase 2 — ICP: "Who are you looking for?" (5 questions + confirm). Runs twice
//              for two-oar flavors (builder + customer), once for single-oar.
//   Phase 3 — Key Setup: Primary key → validate. Fallback key → validate. CANNOT skip.
//   Phase 4 — Naming Ceremony: Bot name → regenerate SOUL.md
//   Phase 5 — Flywheel Start: Set tenant active, trigger first scout
//
// State is persisted to {tenantId}/onboard_state.json between calls.
// SOUL.md is written to {tenantId}/SOUL.md after Phase 4.
