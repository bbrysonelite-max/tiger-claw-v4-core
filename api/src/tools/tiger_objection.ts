// Tiger Claw — tiger_objection Tool
// Objection handling library with per-flavor buckets — Block 3.6 of TIGERCLAW-MASTER-SPEC-v2.md
//
// LOCKED:
//   Each flavor defines its own objection buckets with pre-built content.
//   Agent matches prospect text → bucket → delivers response.
//   Pattern Interrupt Stories: deployed at stall points, NOT randomly.
//   Flagship: The Airplane Question (network-marketer flavor).
//
// Flavors and their buckets:
//   network-marketer:  compensation | product | time | reputation | trust | family | cost
//   real-estate:       price | market | agent_fees | timing | condition | financing | location
//   health-wellness:   effectiveness | side_effects | cost | time_commitment | provider | skepticism
//
// Pattern interrupts are moment-aware:
//   "stall"      — prospect going quiet, buying-time answers, vague responses
//   "pre-takeaway" — final move before letting go (Airplane Question)
//   "general"    — any reset needed
//
// Actions:
//   classify        — infer bucket from prospect text, return response
//   respond         — given a known bucket, return the response directly
//   pattern_interrupt — return the right story for flavor + moment
//   list_buckets    — list all buckets for current flavor
//   log             — log an objection handling event for record-keeping
