// Tiger Claw — tiger_aftercare Tool
// Stage 5: Retention & Aftercare — Block 3.8 of TIGERCLAW-MASTER-SPEC-v2.md
//
// Two tracks (LOCKED):
//
//   TRACK A — Business Builder Aftercare
//     Phase 1  Day 1-7:   Welcome sequence, first steps, product basics
//     Phase 2  Day 8-30:  Skill building, first conversations, 3-per-day rule
//     Phase 3  Day 31-90: Momentum, activity tracking, wins/struggles
//     Phase 4  Ongoing:   30/60/90 day check-ins, inactive flagging, high performer recognition
//
//   TRACK B — Customer Aftercare (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
//     Bronze: Welcome, 7-day check-in, monthly satisfaction survey, referral ask
//     Silver: All Bronze + full 7-touch referral campaign, upsell sequence, usage reports
//     Gold:   All Silver + annual plan offers, quarterly review calls, double referral bonus, VIP early access
//
//     Tier promotion triggered by: purchase frequency, referral count, engagement.
//     Tenant can override tier manually.
//
//   Customer-to-Builder Upgrade Detection (LOCKED):
//     Bot watches for builder signals: enthusiasm, multiple referrals, business questions.
//     3+ referrals → flag to tenant: "They're showing builder signals."
//     Tenant responds: yes / no / "I'll handle personally."
//
//   Inactive detection (Track A): no response after 2 consecutive touches → flag to tenant.
//   High performer detection (Track A): consistent engagement → proactive recognition.
//
// Cron fires `check` daily.
// Actions: enroll | check | mark_sent | record_signal | set_tier | list
