# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for Tiger Claw.

Each ADR documents a significant architectural decision: the context that led to it, the decision made, and the consequences. ADRs are immutable once accepted — new decisions create new ADRs rather than modifying old ones.

## How to Add a New ADR

1. Create a new file: `NNNN-short-title.md` (next number in sequence)
2. Use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: Title

**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [names]

## Context
[What is the situation that forced this decision?]

## Decision
[What was decided?]

## Consequences
[What are the positive and negative results?]

## Status of Implementation
[Is this built? Pending? In what phase?]
```

3. Add it to the index above
4. Commit to GitHub immediately — ADRs are the source of truth
