## What Tiger Claw Is

AI sales agent SaaS. Operator brings their own Telegram bot token (BYOB — from BotFather) and their own Gemini API key (BYOK). One-page signup. Bot hatches knowing its ICP. The agent prospects while the operator sleeps.

- **API:** `https://api.tigerclaw.io` — Cloud Run, project `hybrid-matrix-472500-k5`, `us-central1`
- **Admin dashboard:** `wizard.tigerclaw.io/admin/dashboard`
- **Admin token:** `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="tiger-claw-admin-token" --project="hybrid-matrix-472500-k5"`
- **DB:** Cloud SQL proxy port **5433** locally (NOT 5432), user `botcraft`, DB `tiger_claw_shared`
- **No AI agent pushes to main.** All changes via `feat/` or `fix/` branch + PR.

## Session 18 — What Was Done (2026-04-09)

### PRs Merged to Main

| PR | What |
|----|------|
| #274 | Remove bot pool — 5,559 lines deleted. All `bot_pool` DB functions, `/admin/pool/*` routes, ops scripts, docs gone. `pool.ts` is crypto/Telegram utilities only. Eliminated the silent fallback chain (missing BYOK → platform key → 429 → OpenRouter) that burned $100. |
| #275 | Post-#274 collateral fix — `updateTenantChannelConfig` accidentally deleted from `db.ts`. `/admin/fix-pool-orphans` route still referenced deleted function. Deploy was failing; this unblocked it. |
| #276 | Session docs update — SOTU.md, STATE_OF_THE_TIGER_PATH_FORWARD.md updated for PRs #274–#275. |
| #277 | Repo cleanup — `api/cloud-sql-proxy` (32 MB binary) untracked from git. 37 loose scripts moved from `api/` root → `api/scripts/`. 4 stale audit markdown files → `docs/archive/`. `.claude/worktrees/` added to `.gitignore`. |
| #278 | Agent context fix — `buildSystemPrompt` empty identity fields no longer render as blank lines. `hasOnboarding` requires real identity data, not just `phase=complete`. `displayOperatorName` fallback in prospect phrases. Provisioner writes `phase="identity"` when no product provided at hatch. |
| #279 | Ground-truth doc rewrite — all documents rewritten from codebase audit. Documentation protocol established as Rule 16. |
| #280 | Admin hatch custom ICP — `/admin/hatch` now accepts `icpProspect` and `icpProduct`. Bot wakes with operator's exact ICP, not just flavor defaults. |
| #281 | ICP field rename — `icpBuilder` → `icpProspect`, `icpCustomer` → `icpProduct` everywhere: TypeScript interfaces, DB reads/writes, system prompts, tools, tests, docs. String rename only — no schema changes. |
| #282 | Commander-language cleanup — wizard UI: ICP step removed (4-step flow), `sales-tiger` flavor removed from signup, internal terms replaced (ICP/hatch/flavor/pipeline). `StepCustomerProfile.tsx` deleted. Dashboard shows "Tiger Agent" not flavor string. |

### Also Done This Session (not in PRs)

- 18 stale tenant records deleted from DB — only `brents-tiger-01-mns7wcqk` (Tiger Proof) remains.
- `onboard_state.json` written directly to DB for `brents-tiger-01-mns7wcqk` with full identity and ICP (phase=complete, Nu Skin, icpProspect, icpProduct blocks). Not yet verified live.
- Documentation protocol established: done = tested, debugged, merged, and deployed. No exceptions.

## What Is Broken / Open

| Item | Impact | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `brents-tiger-01-mns7wcqk` not tested | Webhook fixed, onboard_state complete, bot not verified from a fresh chatId | Test first next session |
| Paddle product/price | No checkout URL — payment path unproven | Create in Paddle dashboard |
| Admin alert markdown bug | Alerts with underscores fail silently | Fix when convenient |
| Payment gate open (C4) | Anyone can access wizard without paying | Fix after Paddle loop proven |
| Reddit 403 from Cloud Run | Mine uses Oxylabs + Serper fallback (working) | Awaiting Reddit API or proxy |

---

## Platform State (Verified)

### Infrastructure
- Cloud Run: healthy, revision `tiger-claw-api-00442-tjd`
- Postgres, Redis, all 6 workers: OK
- Telegram webhook delivery: wired, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in deploy
- Serper keys (×3): round-robin active
- Oxylabs: live, 684 facts on last manual run
- Resend email: confirmed working
- Vercel auto-deploy: confirmed working
- Paddle webhook: live (`POST /webhooks/paddle`)

### Codebase (Verified by Session 18 Audit)
- **Routes:** 22 route files, ~82 endpoints
- **Services:** 24 service files
- **Tools registered in toolsMap:** 26
- **Workers:** 6 active BullMQ workers, 10 queues defined (4 queues have no worker)
- **Migrations:** 25 applied
- **Flavors:** 16 in registry
- **Tests:** 456/456 passing, 44 files

### BYOB / BYOK
- Every operator provides their own bot token from BotFather. No pool. Ever.
- Every operator provides their own Gemini API key.
- Circuit breaker: Gemini errors → OpenRouter fallback (active).

## Session 17 — What Was Done (2026-04-08/09)

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #263 | Orchestrator Redis SETNX dedup — Reporting Agent was firing 5× per mine run. |
| #264 | Strike harvest root cause — `verbatim` column missing. First successful run: 20 links, admin alert delivered. |
| #265 | Rule 13 — update docs after every merge. |
| #267 | Dashboard contrast fix. |
| #269 | Provisioner botName top-level fix — Gemini was seeing "Bot name: —" and entering confused self-onboarding loop. |
| #270 | Prospect engagement mode — WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO block, dream injection, covenant opening. |
| #271 | Bot description + /start message fixed. Tiger Claw brand removed from public-facing text. |
| #272 | No tool names in responses — all tiger_* variants blocked. |

---

## Session 16 — What Was Done (2026-04-06/08)

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #255 | ICP hard-wire — bot wakes calibrated, no interview. |
| #261 | 4-language /start + language matching + Strike pipeline wired. |
| #252 | Duplicate tenant bug fixed. |
| #260 | `tiger_book_zoom` built (Cal.com). Inactive pending architecture decision. |

## Tech Debt

| Item | Priority |
|------|----------|
| 4 BullMQ queues with no worker (global-cron, market-mining, market-intelligence-batch, stan-store-onboarding) | MEDIUM |
| Admin alert markdown bug (underscores break Telegram parser) | MEDIUM |
| serperKeyIndex + serperCallsThisRun are module-level globals — broken under concurrency | HIGH |
| Payment gate open (C4) | HIGH — after Paddle loop proven |
| Telegram message dedup missing | MEDIUM |
| Stan Store / Stripe dead code | LOW |
