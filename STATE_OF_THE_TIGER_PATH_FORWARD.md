## Current Focus

**Agent intelligence + first real conversation.** Tigeralldaytest is the active bot with a valid BYOK Gemini key. Bot pool dead code is gone. Next: validate agent conversation quality and wire Cal.com booking.

## Sessions 15–17 — What Was Done (2026-04-06 to 2026-04-08)

### Session 18 — PR #274

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #274 | Remove bot pool: 5,559 lines deleted. All `bot_pool` DB functions, `/admin/pool/*` routes, ops scripts, docs gone. `pool.ts` is crypto/Telegram utilities only. BYOB rule added loudly to CLAUDE.md and RULES.md. Eliminated the silent fallback chain (missing BYOK → platform key → 429 → OpenRouter) that burned $100. 456/456 tests passing. |

### Session 17 — PRs #263–#272

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #263 | Orchestrator Redis SETNX dedup — Reporting Agent was firing 5x per mine run due to research agent retry counts. Moved `markFactsQueued` before `draftReplies` in Strike pipeline. |
| #264 | Strike harvest root cause: `verbatim` column doesn't exist in `market_intelligence`. SQL crash on every run since wiring. Removed from SELECT, interface, and prompt. First successful run confirmed: 20 engagement links, admin alert delivered. |
| #265 | Rule 13 added to RULES.md: update RULES.md + SOTU.md after every merge. |
| #267 | Dashboard contrast fix — admin fleet dashboard and customer dashboard illegible gray-on-dark text bumped to readable contrast levels. |
| #268 | Session docs update (partial) — START_HERE, ARCHITECTURE, STATE_OF_THE_TIGER_PATH_FORWARD updated. |
| #269 | Provisioner botName top-level fix (CRITICAL) — `botName` written inside `identity{}` only; code reads at top level. Gemini saw "Bot name: —" and entered confused self-onboarding loop. Fixed: `botName` + `completedAt` written at top level on every hatch. Direct DB fix + polluted fact_anchors cleaned on live bot. |
| #270 | Prospect engagement mode — system prompt was 100% operator-management frame. Added: WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO block, dream injection directive, covenant opening for new conversations, HARD RULE: never surface internal state. 4 prospect voice examples added. |
| #271 | Bot description + /start message — description exposed "Tiger Claw" brand to prospects. Replaced with covenant line. /start ending "I'm having my nails done later!" → "What's going on for you right now?" Live bot updated immediately. |
| #272 | No tool names in responses — previous rule missed shorthand variants (tigerlead, tigernurture, tigerstrikedraft, etc.). Explicitly listed all variants. Added: never explain reasoning out loud mid-message. |

### Sessions 15–16 — PRs #235–#261

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #235 | Verbatim field in `tiger_refine.ts` — exact quotes required, 15-char minimum. Mine producing 1,684 facts/run with Oxylabs. |
| #236 | Paddle webhook integration — HMAC-SHA256 verification, Redis idempotency, provisions BYOK user+bot+subscription on `transaction.completed`. |
| #237 | Wizard flavor fix — 5 cut flavors removed, 8 canonical flavors remain. |
| #251 | Bot-status fix — `wizard/bot-status` returned `pending` for admin-hatched bots. Added `'live'` status to isLive checks. |
| #252 | Duplicate tenant bug — hatch was creating two records due to slug generated twice with different `Date.now()`. |
| #253 | Dashboard isLive fix + Stan Store copy cleanup. |
| #255 | ICP hard-wire — provisioner pre-seeds `onboard_state.json` at hatch. Bot wakes fully calibrated. No interview. |
| #258 | WHAT_TIGER_CLAW_DOES.md — new product vision doc. |
| #260 | `tiger_book_zoom` — Cal.com booking tool built and registered. Inactive pending booking architecture decision. |
| #261 | 4-language `/start` greeting, language-matching system prompt, Strike pipeline wired to Reporting Agent, Interior Designer removed from wizard. |

## Session 11 — What Was Done (2026-04-05)

Round 2 audit by 5 parallel sub-agents found 38 new issues. Phase 1 (all HIGH severity security) fixed immediately.

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #210 | R2-P1-1/2: GET + POST /dashboard/:slug — added requireSession + ownership check (any attacker could read all tenant data or hijack API key) |
| #210 | R2-P1-3/4/5: PATCH/POST /tenants/:id/status|scout|keys/activate — added requireAdmin (attacker could terminate any bot) |
| #210 | Updated tiger_onboard.ts internal self-calls to pass Authorization header |
| #210 | R2-P1-7: saveMarketFact() now normalizes source URL before storage (moat was accumulating duplicates on every mining run) |
| #210 | Added requireSession middleware export to auth.ts |

**Deployed: revision `tiger-claw-api-00330-6ml`. Health confirmed. Webhooks re-registered.**

**32 remaining issues (Phase 2 + Phase 3) open in `audit-session10-round2.md`.**

## Sessions 9+10 — What Was Done (2026-04-04)

Full reliability & security audit by 6 parallel sub-agents found 57 issues. All resolved or deferred.

---

## Session 8 — What Was Done (2026-04-04)

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #186 | Mine engine controls in admin dashboard — live status indicator, Run Now button, last run stats, `mine_complete` admin event logging |
| #187 | Tool safety audit: 43 new tests (455 total), tiger_gmail_send + tiger_postiz removed from toolsMap, active agent count fixed in /admin/metrics, tiger_strike_draft test fixed |

---

## Session 7 — What Was Done (2026-04-04)

| PR | Fix |
|----|-----|
| #174 | Serper fallback for market miner (Reddit dead 6 days) |

| #176 | RESEND_API_KEY in deploy, admin alert env var names fixed, nurture_check prompt fixed |
| #177 | Dead key alerts routed through sendAdminAlert (not UUID) |

| #181 | tiger_refine registered in toolsMap |
| #182 | getTenant() wrapped in try/catch in webhook hot path |
| #183 | CI test updated to match new rate limit message |
| #184 | tiger_strike_draft FK validation — prevents hallucinated fact UUIDs crashing inserts |
| #185 | System prompt rule: never report tool failures to operator, never ask "what's it gonna be?" |

---

| #139 | `ENABLE_WORKERS=true` added to deploy script permanently |
| #133 | Customer dashboard — inline AI key update + leads section |

### April 3 — Root Cause Fixes + Phase 1 Build

## Deferred Features (Do Not Build Yet)

- **Reflexion Loop** — outcome signals feed back into fact_anchors. Build after 10+ agents have real data.
- **Agent Leaderboard** — opt-in fleet ranking. Build after Reflexion Loop.
- **White label** — hold at affiliate/referral model until Max sells 10.
- **Partner portal / rev share automation** — only if white label deal proves out.

## Infrastructure

| Resource | Value |
|----------|-------|
| GCP Project | `hybrid-matrix-472500-k5` |
| Cloud Run | `tiger-claw-api` (us-central1 primary, asia-southeast1 secondary) |
| Cloud SQL proxy | port **5433** locally, instance `tiger-claw-postgres-ha`, user `botcraft`, DB `tiger_claw_shared` |
| Admin | `wizard.tigerclaw.io/admin` |
| Deploys (API) | `GCP_PROJECT_ID=hybrid-matrix-472500-k5 bash ./ops/deploy-cloudrun.sh` |
| Deploys (Wizard) | Vercel auto-deploy — push to main triggers deploy automatically |
| Post-deploy | Run `POST /admin/fix-all-webhooks` (idempotent — webhook secret now baked into deploy) |

---

## Rules of Engagement

1. One PR per fix. No chaining.
2. `feat/` or `fix/` branches only. No AI agent pushes to main.
3. Architecture is LOCKED. No RAG, no containers, no OpenClaw.
4. No new features without a customer asking for it.
5. No session is marked COMPLETE if known broken items remain unresolved.
6. `tiger_gmail_send` and `tiger_postiz` are intentionally NOT in toolsMap. Do not re-add.
